A clean and efficient implementation of a continuous rotation animation in Flutter using `AnimationController` and matrix transformations.

## Features

- ðŸŒ€ **Smooth 360Â° Rotation**: Uses `Matrix4.rotateZ` for fluid animation.
- âš¡ **Performance Optimized**: Leverages Flutter's animation system with `vsync`.
- ðŸŽ¨ **Customizable Design**: Easily modify the rotating widget's appearance.

## Technical Breakdown

### Core Components
1. **AnimationController**: Manages animation duration and state.
2. **Tween**: Generates values between `0` and `2Ï€` radians (full rotation).
3. **AnimatedBuilder**: Rebuilds widget tree efficiently during animation.
4. **Matrix4 Transform**: Applies 3D rotation around the Z-axis.

### Key Concepts
- **Radians vs Degrees**: Flutter uses radians for rotation calculations (`2Ï€` radians = 360Â°).
- **vsync**: Synchronizes animation with screen refresh rate (60 FPS by default).
- **Transform Layer**: Uses Skia's hardware-accelerated graphics engine.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flutter-rotation-animation.git
